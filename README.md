## 🎶 AI Music Studio — Songwriter & Producer Platform

Your all-in-one **AI-powered music creation suite** — where artists, producers, and songwriters can **create full songs, collaborate, and bring their voice to life with AI**.

## 🧠 About the Project

This project was built to close the gap between **AI songwriting** and **real music creation** — allowing users to go from idea → lyrics → melody → AI vocals, all inside one studio.

The platform is designed around **three membership tiers (Basic, Pro, and Pro+)**, each unlocking deeper creative control, AI tools, and collaboration features.
